 ## Purpose

We were recently approached by a client; an owner of a freshly renovated aquatic centre, Azure Splash. Due to the high volume of patrons, the centre has had to implement mandatory reservations for each pool lane. There are currently two pools with a total of 6 lanes per pool. At the moment, the only way to reserve a lane is via phone or in-person as the facility does not have a website.This has led to multiple customers walking-in and unable to go for a swim, leaving them unsatisfied and resulting in customers visiting a competitor or worse yet, not continuing their patronage. Further, it was keeping staff tied to the phones in order to keep up with reservations, and preventing them from fulfilling their other duties.

The goal for this web application is to enable users to make a booking for available lanes in the allocated time slots. The slots are for half an hour, and each customer can reserve a maximum of two consecutive slots. This will allow customers to be guaranteed a lane, and for staff to be freed up with assisting customers in the venue. In the future, they would like to expand their services by adding a sauna. As such, a ‘coming soon’ booking space for this will be displayed on the web application. This will also enable the centre to introduce other services, such as swimming classes in the future.

The web application will also promote the business by showing off the brand new facilities, as well as the competitive prices. It will also encourage users to create an account, to view availability and make bookings as this will be unavailable to users without an account.The overarching goal is to ensure that the pool is always booked, hence guaranteeing customers a lane when they turn up for a swim.

As a customer, I would like to edit or delete my own bookings in the case of any changes in my schedule.

### Persona 3: Tom

#### Background
Tom is a 30 year-old worker at the aquatic centre. He enjoys working there, but has noticed that the recent spike in customers has resulted in a number of people unable to swim. Further, this has resulted in a recent increase in bookings through the phone, and preventing staff from completing other duties.

#### Goals and Behaviour
Tom would like for customers to be able to view available lanes and time slots, and complete their own bookings instead of calling in to check with staff. 
He would also like to have an overview of all the current and future bookings, as well as unavailable times for lanes to stay informed.

### Worker

As a worker, I want to delete and edit any booking to ensure that I’m able to assist customers with their requests.

As a worker, I would like to see available times and lanes to assist customers with their bookings.

As a worker, I would like to be able to see relevant information regarding maintenance so that I may provide warnings to customers and evacuate the areas if necessary. 


## Wireframes

Figma was used to create wireframes for this project. We decided to use image and full color instead of placeholder images. This will allow quicker approval from the client. After discussions with the owner of Azure Splash, we worked out that most of the users will be using a mobile device. With this in mind we decided to take a mobile first approach to the design. 

### Design Features

#### Color Scheme

![Website colors](./resources/color_scheme.png)

### Buttons

The buttons will be designed with a a slight rounded corner on a rectangle. The standard button will have Azure as a color with black text. Using OnHover the button will change to lighter color, text will be capitalized and white.

![Button examples](./resources/buttons.png)

### Nav Bar

The Nav Bar will be sticky at the top of the page making the menu accessible when scrolling the content on each page. The same color format then the buttons will be used on the Nav Bar. This will keep the site looking uniform and helping the user navigate the site easier.

## Project Management

The following software was used for project management and planning:
- Discord: was used to communicate with each other, text, voice and screen sharing
- Google Docs: used to share ideas and images and other information before loading onto readme.md file
- Trello: for agile planning. Cards and lists were created with the tasks that needed to be completed with due dates. Questions, comments and feedback were also placed on the cards. The requirements were put into cards and then split to task for the team to complete.
